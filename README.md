# Employee Promotion Prediction üìäüîç

## Project Overview üìà
In the dynamic environment of the JMD company, employee promotions are a key factor in driving motivation and loyalty. However, the traditional process of evaluating employee promotion eligibility is time-consuming and complex due to the vast amount of data involved. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict employee promotion eligibility, thus aiding the HR team in making informed decisions efficiently.

## Objectives üéØ
1. **Data Exploration**: Conduct an in-depth analysis and visualization of the employee dataset to understand the factors influencing promotions.
2. **Model Development**: Build a predictive model using classification techniques to forecast promotion eligibility.
3. **Model Optimization**: Utilize various feature selection, model tuning, and optimization strategies to enhance model performance.
4. **Insights Generation**: Derive actionable insights and recommendations for the HR team to streamline the promotion process.

## Data Dictionary üìö
- **employee_id**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **department**: Department in which the employee works.
- **region**: Geographic region of employment.
- **education**: Highest level of education attained.
- **gender**: Employee's gender.
- **recruitment_channel**: Channel through which the employee was recruited.
- **no_of_trainings**: Number of trainings completed last year.
- **age**: Employee's age.
- **previous_year_rating**: Performance rating in the previous year.
- **length_of_service**: Total years of service in the company.
- **awards_won**: Whether the employee won any awards last year.
- **avg_training_score**: Average score in training evaluations.
- **is_promoted** (Target): Whether the employee was promoted.

## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
The project follows a structured approach starting with data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to identify patterns and relationships. Different classification models are then trained and evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed to optimize the model. The final model is selected based on its performance on validation and test datasets.

### 1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
- Handling missing values in columns like `education`, `previous_year_rating`, and `avg_training_score` using imputation techniques.
- Encoding categorical variables using techniques like OneHotEncoding or LabelEncoding for `department`, `region`, `education`, `gender`, and `recruitment_channel`.
- Feature engineering to create new features that might help improve model performance.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualization of distribution of key features (`age`, `avg_training_score`, `length_of_service`) and their relationship with the target variable (`is_promoted`).
- Analysis of categorical variables to understand the impact of departments, education levels, and other factors on promotion.

### 3. **Model Building**
Several classification models could be explored, including but not limited to:
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: To capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and XGBoost**: Powerful ensemble techniques that can improve prediction accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For capturing complex relationships in the data.

### 4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**
- Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.
- Application of techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.

### 5. **Model Optimization**
- Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal settings for the best-performing models.
- Exploration of oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE to handle imbalanced datasets, as promotions are typically less frequent events.

### 6. **Insights and Recommendations üí°**
- Derivation of insights from model coefficients (in case of logistic regression) or feature importances (in case of tree-based models) to understand what factors contribute most to promotion eligibility.
- Recommendations for HR practices based on model findings, such as focusing on training programs, recognizing high performers, or ensuring diversity in promotion decisions.
- **Training and Development**: Employees with higher training scores are more likely to be promoted. Investing in employee development can increase promotion rates.
- **Performance Recognition**: Previous year ratings significantly influence promotion decisions. Recognizing and rewarding high performance can motivate employees.
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: Gender and department diversity should be considered in promotion decisions to ensure equal opportunities.

## How to Use üöÄ
1. **Prepare the Data**: Clean the dataset and handle missing values as per the preprocessing steps outlined in the notebook.
2. **Train the Model**: Use the processed dataset to train the classification model detailed in the notebook.
3. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using the provided metrics and select the best model for predicting promotions.
   
The implementation of these models and strategies would be detailed in the project's Jupyter Notebook (`EmployeePromotionPrediction.ipynb`), with code snippets, outputs, and explanations for each step from data loading to final model evaluation.
